# Introduction to Database

## Description

Create database with PostgreSQL for Creating a Wide Table in a Logistics Company:

This project aims to assist a logistics company in optimizing their operational data management through the creation of a "wide table" using PostgreSQL. The wide table will merge essential information such as shipments, warehouses, available goods, delivery times, and customer data into a more integrated entity. This will facilitate data analysis, enable trend identification, and improve decision-making concerning operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The project will utilize PostgreSQL as the database management system, combining the strengths of a relational database system with the flexibility of handling complex wide tables. Query optimization and indexing will also be implemented to ensure the database's performance remains fast and responsive, even with large and intricate logistics data. As a result, the logistics company is expected to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer service quality while gaining better insights for timely and strategic decision-making.

## Table-Location

1. I create CTE to take the province, city, and district code.
2. Since the data types were varchar, so I use left syntax to take the code for each province, city, and district code.
3. After that, I have join the CTE to make it more complete with the total data was 65 row. It based on the total of the district that have 65 distric.
4. Because this table will be used in the widetable, so I have to change the code that uses comma to space then make it to int in order have the same data type with the fact table.

## Wide-Table

After finished the location table, then we can create the wide table using left join.

## View

To create the "view_summaryfee" view, here are the specifications:

The "view_summaryfee" is a summary that displays the total fee and average fee on a daily basis for each warehouse.

Specifications for the "view_summaryfee" view:

1. This view will present data based on daily information, meaning the data will be calculated and displayed for each individual day.
2. The view will have two main columns: "Total Fee" and "Average Fee."
3. The "Total Fee" column will show the accumulated total fee value for each day in each warehouse.
4. The "Average Fee" column will display the average fee value per day in each warehouse.
5. The data used to populate the "view_summaryfee" view will be retrieved from a table or other data source that contains fee information and transaction dates.
6. The purpose of this view is to provide an overview of the fees generated by each warehouse on a daily basis, making it easier to analyze and monitor the performance of the warehouses.
7. 
Once the "view_summaryfee" view is created, it can be used to quickly and easily view the summary of total and average fees on a daily basis for each warehouse, without the need for manual calculations each time this information is required
